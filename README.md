Text to Qr Code with Java
-----------------------

Generate qr code with least java code.
```
Only the generation algorithm, there isnt scan ,image and more algrithms.
```

I just want to generate qr code with minimal code. Then i don't want to use zxing to create qr code, that's too big. So, I wrote the repo.

I just created `QrCode#toColorArr` method,others is the same as [original code](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator/tree/v1.5.0/java/src/main/java/io/nayuki/qrcodegen).

If you encounter some errors.Pls create a [new issue](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator/issues/new).



## Thanks
